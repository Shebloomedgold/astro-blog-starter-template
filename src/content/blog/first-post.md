Emma, by choice, dirt poor herbalist who is in love with her best friend.
For years her best friend Raike has been the reason she's stayed in their village after her parents died. Struggling to make ends meet but enduring it in hopes that one day her best friend will look at her the same way she's looked at him for years. But all of her hopes come crashing down when on the day she decides to confess he meets the love of his life.

Now with a broken heart, Emma is forced to move on and find something else to fill the hole that he's left behind. And what better way to do that than to go to the capital and become the kingdom's greatest herbalist? Well, it’s either that or be executed for treason.
